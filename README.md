## Welcome to my repository of Full Stack MBA classes

My name is Lucas Passos(LVKIN) and I'm studying Full Stack MBA at College Impacta. In this moment, I have 20 years old and be **Front end Developer.**

My focus is to become an expert in the three main areas of web development: back-end, front-end and mobile development.

I currently have experience in CSS, JavaScript Vanilla, WordPress, React JS and jQuery.

Here some notes of some classes, activities requested by the teachers and the creation of the future project proposed by the college.

I am open to new challenges and projects. Thus, if you want to set up a conversation and have a coffee, I leave some contacts below:
